# Hello LEC QA Team!
### for any future user, just adding tips/steps for setting the project on your device
Here we go :
1. it's important to have the SSH key sat up and added to your device,
   here you can show the steps to take: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/
2. clone the project into you device(I prefer to create dir as 'Workplace' to separate from any other files):
   ```git clone git@bitbucket.org:dl_repository/qa-lec-web.git```
3. Use IntelliJ to open the project
4. Download the latest JDK LTS from: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
5. type ```java â€“version``` on terminal
6. select Intellij -> File -> Project structure
    1. from Project make sure that your Java JDK is selected as SDK

will update this regularly as how the time allow
